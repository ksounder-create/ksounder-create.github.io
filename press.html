Press
Announcement
“I have identified and validated the governing rules by which biological systems operate using existing experimental data.”
— Soundar Krish
This website documents the public launch of a completed scientific discovery:
the governing rules of biology.
These rules are not hypotheses or models. They are logically necessary constraints derived from publicly available experimental data accumulated over several decades across molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, pharmacology, and disease biology.
The discovery comprises more than two dozen interlocking rules, each falsifiable by a single genuine contradiction, none of which has been found.
The purpose of this site is to explain why such rules must exist, why biology missed them, and why their existence changes the future of medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence.

About the Discoverer

Why This Is Being Released Publicly
This discovery does not fit inside the normal peer-review and grant pipeline, which is designed to validate work within an existing framework — not to test whether the framework itself is incomplete.
A public, media-initiated release ensures:
authorship and timestamp
open logical scrutiny
and institutional engagement
This is how every foundational shift in science has entered the world.

Press FAQ — What the Rules Are Expected to Resolve
(These are not promises. They are the questions a lawful biology must be able to answer.)

Why do genetic mutations sometimes matter and sometimes not?
A single governing rule unites and defines the phenotypic effects of hereditary mutations in humans — determining when a change must produce disease and when it cannot.

Why do drugs often have broad or unexpected effects?
Drugs interact with specific functional groups within molecules, not with entire proteins or enzymes. This is why the same drug can produce multiple effects across different tissues and pathways.

Why is disease treatment so fragmented today?
Treating disease requires a holistic, rule-based understanding of how molecular processes across the cell are linked — not just a focus on one target or pathway.

Why can’t medicine yet be truly predictive and causal?
When human biology is fully described by governing rules, healthcare can shift from reactive treatment to mechanistic intervention guided by molecular logic rather than trial-and-error.

Why has progress in cancer been slower than expected?
Improper understanding of fundamental processes such as replication, transcription, and molecular regulation is a major reason cancer remains difficult to control.

Why have decades of research failed to fully explain even one disease or one molecule?
Working from the wrong or incomplete biological fundamentals has prevented any disease from being closed at the mechanistic level, despite massive investment.

Why are drugs discovered rather than designed?
Most drugs are optimized through screening, clinical trials, and statistical analysis rather than through complete molecular understanding — because governing rules have been missing.

How the Discovery Can Be Tested
The governing rules announced here are not private or proprietary ideas. They are derived from publicly available experimental data.
Anyone can attempt to verify or falsify them.
If even one genuine contradiction exists in the scientific record, the framework fails.
If none exists, the rules stand.
This test can begin from any biological question — a mutation, a drug, a disease, a pathway, or a cellular process — and be traced through existing literature.
